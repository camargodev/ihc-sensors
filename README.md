# ihc-sensors

Exercises following the instructions given by the professor.

Remarks: 
- on exercise 5, I created a new activity to add the new sensor, keeping exercise 4 screen with only one sensor
- on exercise 5, I tried to use proximity, but the results were odd, so I used the giroscope
- on exercise 6, the tutorial said to perform the lat/long display on MainActivity, but I did on Task6 activity, since I decided to separate each task on a different screen
